### Meeting Objective
The objective of this session was to discuss and establish the necessary architectural requirements and implementation steps for enabling health information exchange using FHIR standards. Specifically, the focus was on pushing FHIR-compliant payloads from the DHIS2 Tracker for HPV to the FHIR IG server and ensuring successful data exchange back from the server. By the end of this meeting, participants aimed to have a clear understanding of the application architecture needed to support this integration, identify potential challenges, and outline a plan for effective implementation and testing.

### Minutes

**12:05 PM**
- Pike initiated the discussion by describing the current status and possible future actions, suggesting the creation of a summary. Ryan contributed additional insights.
- Chisanga walked the team through the API, while Pike discussed potential issues with it.
- Ryan mentioned Event Hooks and the team's plan to use web hooks for specific events, such as immunization events.
- Ryan suggested using Open FN, a flow automation building platform.
- Farai asked Ryan to explain the process of restricting FHIR resources.
- Ryan shared a GitHub repository example of using Open FN.
- Pike shared a GitHub link to Zambia Immunizations.
- Marvin and Terence inquired about the platform for running the solution (Pike's machine or a remote machine). It was suggested to start locally with Pike's machine and potentially move to a remote setup later.
- Ryan suggested designing high-level architectural diagrams for visualization.
- Discussions ensued about using either Open FN or a custom mediator to transform the HPV record into a FHIR record.
- With team input, Ryan created a high-level architectural diagram.
- It was proposed to form two teams: one to implement Open FN and the other to implement the Custom Mediator, to determine the most viable solution.
- Chisanga explained the DHIS2-tracker to provide the necessary context.
- Ryan created a Hackathon GitHub repository for the team.
- Chisanga suggested using the pre-configured remote machine (FHIR IG instance) as the platform for running the solution.
- Pike explored enabling webhooks on DHIS2.
- Ryan called for a lunch break at 13:14.

**15:00 PM - Post Lunch Session**
- Chisanga and Ryan briefed Simon and another participant on the proposed solution.
- Chisanga shared the DHIS2 meta-data.
- Pike shared the bundle.
- Chisanga assisted Pike with accessing DHIS2.
- Pike configured webhooks, bootstrapped a sample Node.js application, and discussed triggering the webhooks with Ryan.
